TRSWalker.Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 procedure TRSWalker.Setup(Map: String; Manage: Boolean = True; Scaling: Int32 = 10);

Setup a RSWalker variable.
This only needs calling once per variable so it's suggested to use a global variable.
This method is to be called before using the walking functionality.

Other parameters that you can set up after are:
* RSW.ScreenWalk := True;
	If this is set to True, RSW will walk on the mainscreen.

* RSW.FancyMouse := True;
	If this is set to True, RSW will attempt to make the mousemovement a little more human.

* RSW.ClickRandomness := 5;
	This is by default 4, it's the radius of the area we click in the path to make the path more random.


Parameters
----------

Map
	File path to an image or a map name found in *SRL/osr/walker/maps*.

Manage
  Automatically free walker at the end of the script. Only works if the TRSWalker variable is global. (Default: True)

Scaling
	Multipler to downscale the map. Lower will bring more accuracy at the cost of speed. (Default: 9)

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  var Walker: TRSWalker;

  Walker.Setup('world'); // Setup using the world map found in the maps directory


------------

TRSWalker.GetMyPos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalker.GetMyPos: TPoint;

Returns the players current position on the loaded map.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  WriteLn(Walker.GetMyPos());

  // Check to see the match percentage if needed
  WriteLn(Walker.Similarity);


------------

TRSWalker.WalkPath
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalker.WalkPath(Path: TPointArray; WaitUntilDistance: Int32 = 0): Boolean;

Walks a path of points taken from the loaded map. We advice that WaitUntilDistance is not 0.

Parameters
----------

Path
	Array of points taken from the loaded map to walk. Must be ordered from start to finish.

WaitUntilDistance
	Determines when the method returns once the final point has been clicked. Default value: 0.

	| *WaitUntilDistance=0* waits until the player has reached the final point.
	| *WaitUntilDistance=20* waits until the player is within 20 pixels of the final point.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  Walker.WalkPath([[100,100],[120,120],[140,140],[160,160],[180,180]]);


------------

TRSWalker.WalkBlind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalker.WalkBlind(Destination: TPoint; WaitUntilDistance: Int32 = 0): Boolean;

"Blindly" walks to a point taken from the loaded map.
A straight line is generated between the player's position and destination which is then walked.

Parameters
----------

Destination
	Destination point taken from the loaded map.

WaitUntilDistance
	Determines when the method returns once the final point has been clicked. Default value: 0.

	| *WaitUntilDistance=0* waits until the player has reached the final point.
	| *WaitUntilDistance=20* waits until the player is within 20 pixels of the final point.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  Walker.WalkBlind([300, 300]);


------------

TRSWalker.WebWalk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TRSWalker.WebWalk(Destination: TPoint; WaitUntilDistance: Int32 = 0; PathRandomness: Extended = 0): Boolean;

Web walks to the destination point on the loaded map. Does **not** handle any obstacles.
Please run ``webber.simba`` to see how webgraphs are built.

Pre built webgraphs are available for "World" and "Zeah" when used.

Parameters
----------

Destination
	Destination point taken from the loaded map.

WaitUntilDistance
	Determines when the method returns once the final point has been clicked. Default value: 0.

	| *WaitUntilDistance=0* waits until the player has reached the final point.
	| *WaitUntilDistance=20* waits until the player is within 20 pixels of the final point.

PathRandomness
	Randomness to add to the path so the absoulte shortest path isn't always taken. Must be between 0..1

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  var Walker: TRSWalker;

  Walker.Setup('world');
  Walker.WebWalk([4595, 3575]); // Lumbridge

  // Or use a location from the webgraph
  Walker.WebWalk(WorldWeb.LOCATION_LUMBRIDGE);
