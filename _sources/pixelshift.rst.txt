Pixelshift
=============
Stuff that relate to checking the "pixelshift", ie how many pixels changed in an area


------------

SRL.GetPixelShift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TSRL.GetPixelShift(Area: TBox; WaitTime: UInt32): Int32;

Returns how many pixels changed in the given area ``Area`` after ``WaitTime`` has passed.


------------

SRL.GetPixelShiftTPA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TSRL.GetPixelShiftTPA(Area: TBox; WaitTime: UInt32; Count: Int32=1; AcceptLength:Int32=0): TPointArray;

Returns a TPA containing all the pixels that changed during the ``WaitTime`` period.

The function can repeat the period ``WaitTime`` and continue building the result ``Count`` times.

if ``AcceptLength`` is none-zero, it will return when / if this many pixels has changed.


------------

SRL.IsAnimating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function TSRL.IsAnimating(Area:TBox; Shift, WaitTime:UInt32; Iter:UInt32=1): Boolean;

Counts the pixels that changed in the period ``WaitTime`` and checks if ``Shift`` value was met if it was
the it will return ``True``. The check itself can be repeated several times ``Iter``

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

.. code-block:: pascal


  if srl.IsAnimating(Box(10,10, 100,100), 350, 500, 3) then
    WriteLn('Shit changed');

In the example we supply a random area, and checks if 350 pixels changed within 500ms, we repeat 
that test 3 times, or until the condition ``350 pixels`` was met.
